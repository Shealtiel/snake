# Python Snake

Python OOP(?) Snake on curses.

## How to run

``` bash
python main.py
```

## Known issues

- Pressing key of the opposite direction will cause death
- Magic methods of Coordinates() are really used only in snake.move(), so it can be simplified to just tuple

Do not use as a course assignment.
